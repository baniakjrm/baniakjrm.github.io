- update the upgrade tip message on mobile to represent the upgrade button
- fix the landscape upgrade menu from spilling off the side.
- make the upgrade button 70% of its current size to be less obtrusive on mobile.
- integrate (final boss ticket) and final boss system, where you have one attempt per ticket to beat the final boss
and basically you have to clear a room, and then if dead end, then the way you came becomes boss hallway with torches.
otherwise randomly one of the exits becomes the boss hallway. Boss hallway is long hallway with torches, that when you reach
the end, its a huge room with one large pillar in the middle and 12 around it, and you fight the boss in this arena.
The final bosses color increases as he takes damage, and he becomes more and more difficult as he loses health, and he 
becomes more red.
-Make it so that the mobile upgrade button has black arrow and black border by default but if you can afford an upgrade
 then it becomes white arrow white border
-remove dead end L tiles, and replace them (randomness wise) with the non dead-end ones. so the amount of L tiles you find is the same, just less dead ends.
